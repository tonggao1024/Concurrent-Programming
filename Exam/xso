#
# Use scala to run a compiled Scala/CSO program
#
# Usage: xso [scala parameters]
#
# Default path where cso (and other) .jar file(s) are found is          ./PUBLISH
# Default path into which class files are placed is                     ./BUILD
# These can be overridden by setting the environment variables  JARPATHS/BUILDPATH
# or by placing assignments to these variables in the file      ./XSOPATHS
#
# Supplementary scala parameters are used to set paramaters used 
# by components of the cso library. They are delivered to the scala
# runtime in the environment variable XSOPARAMS (whose default value sets
# the cso debugger port to 8000, and the process pool time to 2 seconds)
