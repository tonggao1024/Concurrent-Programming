# Use scalac to compile scala/cso program

# Default path where cso (and other) .jar file(s) are found is          ./PUBLISH
# Default path into which class files are placed is                     ./BUILD
# These can be overridden by setting the environment variables  JARPATHS/BUILDPATH
# or by placing assignments to these variables in the file      ./XSOPATHS
